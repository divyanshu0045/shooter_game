# Unity Scene File - Level 1: Downtown Streets
#
# NOTE: This is a simplified, human-readable representation of a Unity scene.
# Due to the complexity of Unity's internal fileID and GUID system, this file
# cannot be directly opened by Unity. Instead, use it as a blueprint to
# reconstruct the scene in the Unity Editor.
