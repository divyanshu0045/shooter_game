At this point, all the code-related tasks from our comprehensive plan are complete. The project now has a robust and feature-rich foundation.

Here is a summary of the pending work:

#1. Scene and Prefab Assembly:

Create Scenes: In the Unity Editor, create new scenes for the MainMenu, LevelSelect, Settings, and the three game levels.
Build Scene Hierarchies: Follow the .unity text blueprints I provided to create all the necessary GameObjects (GameManager, PlayerRig, EnemySpawnManager, etc.) in each scene.
Create Prefabs: Create prefabs for all the enemy types, weapon types, and civilians. Attach the corresponding C# scripts to these prefabs.

#2. Asset Integration & Linking:

Import Assets: Import all your 3D models, audio files (music, SFX), particle effects (VFX), fonts, and textures into your Unity project.
Assign Models: Place your 3D models into the scenes for the environment, and assign the enemy/weapon models to their respective prefabs.
Link Scripts to Components: In the Inspector for each GameObject, drag and drop the required components to the public fields on the scripts (e.g., linking the bossHealthBar Slider in the UI to the field on the UIManager).
Assign VFX/SFX: Drag your particle systems and audio clips onto the corresponding public fields in the PlayerShooting, EnemyAI, and BossAI scripts.

#3. UI Construction:

Build Canvases: Design the visual layout for your Main Menu, Level Select screen, Settings screen, and the in-game HUD.
Hook Up Buttons: Connect the OnClick() events of your UI Buttons to the public methods in the manager scripts (e.g., connecting the "Start Game" button to the StartGame() method on the MainMenuManager).

#4. Playtesting and Balancing:

Tune Gameplay: Play through the levels and adjust the public values in the Inspector for things like weapon damage, enemy health, fireRate, and spawn counts to get the game feel just right.
Essentially, the entire code architecture is complete. The next step is to use the Unity Editor to assemble all the pieces and provide the visual and audio content.

Have fun!
